favorite_sport = """My favourite sport is basketball.\nI love the fast-paced nature of the game, and the way that each possession can swing the momentum of the game in an instant. There's nothing quite like the feeling of hitting a big shot or making a game-saving block.\n One of the things I love most about basketball is the way that it requires both skill and athleticism. You need to be able to shoot, pass, and dribble with precision, but you also need to have the speed, agility, and jumping ability to outmanoeuvre your opponents.\n Another great thing about basketball is that it can be played almost anywhere. Whether you're playing on a fancy indoor court or a makeshift hoop in the park, the game is still the same. All you need is a ball and a hoop, and you're good to go. \n Overall, I think basketball is an amazing sport that combines athleticism, skill, and strategy in a way that few other sports can match. It's my favourite sport, and I can't get enough of it."""
