print("My favorite dish is chana masala. It is a popular North Indian dish made with chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, and a blend of spices. Chana masala is usually served with naan or rice and has a rich and flavorful taste that I love. I enjoy eating chana masala both at home and at restaurants, and it's a dish that I always look forward to having.\n"
      '''Vegetarian food is not only tasty but also healthy, and there are so many vegetarian dishes in Indian cuisine that are full of nutrients and flavor. I also love dishes like palak paneer, which is made with spinach and paneer cheese, and baingan bharta, which is a flavorful eggplant dish. Vegetarianism is a great choice for those who want to take care of their health and the environment, and I am proud to be a vegetarian myself.\n''')
